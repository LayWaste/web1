    The W3C Advisory Committee has elected the following people to fill six seats on the W3C Advisory Board starting 1 July 2021: Heejin Chung (Samsung Electronics), Avneesh Singh (DAISY Consortium), Eric Siow (Intel), Léonie Watson (TetraLogical), Chris Wilson (Google) and Hongru (Judy) Zhu (Alibaba) will join continuing participants Tantek Çelik (Mozilla), Tatsuya Igarashi (Sony), Florian Rivoal (W3C Invited Expert), Tzviya Siegman (Wiley) and David Singer (Apple). Many thanks to the 7 candidates, and to Elika J Etemad (W3C Invited Expert) whose term ends this month.

    Created in March 1998, the Advisory Board provides ongoing guidance to the W3C Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. The Advisory Board manages the evolution of the Process Document. The elected Members of the Advisory Board participate as individual contributors and not representatives of their organizations. Advisory Board participants use their best judgment to find the best solutions for the Web, not just for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user.
